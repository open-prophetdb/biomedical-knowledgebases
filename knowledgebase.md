### PrimeKG: A Knowledge Graph for Precision Medicine.
PrimeKG integrates 20 high-quality resources to describe 17,080 diseases with 4,050,249 relationships representing ten major biological scales, including disease-associated protein perturbations, biological processes and pathways, anatomical and phenotypic scales, and the entire range of approved drugs with their therapeutic action, considerably expanding previous efforts in disease-rooted knowledge graphs. PrimeKG contains an abundance of 'indications', 'contradictions', and 'off-label use' drug-disease edges that lack in other knowledge graphs and can support AI analyses of how drugs affect disease-associated networks.

### PreMedKB: an integrated precision medicine knowledgebase for interpreting relationships between diseases, genes, variants and drugs
Precision Medicine Knowledgebase (PreMedKB) integrate the four fundamental components of precision medicine: diseases, genes, variants and drugs. PreMedKB allows for search of comprehensive information within each of the four components, the relationships between any two or more components, and importantly, the interpretation of the clinical meanings of a patient's genetic variants. PreMedKB is an efficient and user-friendly tool to assist researchers, clinicians or patients in interpreting a patient's genetic profile in terms of discovering potential pathogenic variants, recommending therapeutic regimens, designing panels for genetic testing kits, and matching patients for clinical trials.

### Orphanet Data

Orphanet is a unique resource, gathering and improving knowledge on rare diseases so as to improve the diagnosis, care and treatment of patients with rare diseases. Orphanet aims to provide high-quality information on rare diseases, and ensure equal access to knowledge for all stakeholders. Orphanet also maintains the Orphanet rare disease nomenclature (ORPHAcode), essential in improving the visibility of rare diseases in health and research information systems.

Orphanet was established in France by the INSERM (French National Institute for Health and Medical Research) in 1997.This initiative became a European endeavour from 2000, supported by grants from the European Commission: Orphanet has gradually grown to a Consortium of 40 countries, within Europe and across the globe.

### Human Symptoms Disease Network (HSDN)

Use large-scale medical bibliographic records and the related Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) metadata from PubMed, to generate a symptom-based network of human diseases (Human Symptoms Disease Network, HSDN), where the link weight between two diseases quantifies the similarity of their respective symptoms. By integrating disease–gene association and protein–protein interaction (PPI) data, we investigate the correlations between the symptom similarity of diseases and their degree of shared genes or PPIs.
