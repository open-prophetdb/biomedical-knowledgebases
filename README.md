## BioMedical Knowledges

A collection of biomedical knowledgebases, ontologies, and datasets.

### Knowledgebases

#### PrimeKG: A Knowledge Graph for Precision Medicine.
PrimeKG integrates 20 high-quality resources to describe 17,080 diseases with 4,050,249 relationships representing ten major biological scales, including disease-associated protein perturbations, biological processes and pathways, anatomical and phenotypic scales, and the entire range of approved drugs with their therapeutic action, considerably expanding previous efforts in disease-rooted knowledge graphs. PrimeKG contains an abundance of 'indications', 'contradictions', and 'off-label use' drug-disease edges that lack in other knowledge graphs and can support AI analyses of how drugs affect disease-associated networks.

#### PreMedKB: an integrated precision medicine knowledgebase for interpreting relationships between diseases, genes, variants and drugs
Precision Medicine Knowledgebase (PreMedKB) integrate the four fundamental components of precision medicine: diseases, genes, variants and drugs. PreMedKB allows for search of comprehensive information within each of the four components, the relationships between any two or more components, and importantly, the interpretation of the clinical meanings of a patient's genetic variants. PreMedKB is an efficient and user-friendly tool to assist researchers, clinicians or patients in interpreting a patient's genetic profile in terms of discovering potential pathogenic variants, recommending therapeutic regimens, designing panels for genetic testing kits, and matching patients for clinical trials.

### Ontologies

#### OxO: EMBL-EBI Ontology Xref Service (OxO)

OxO is a service for finding mappings (or cross-references) between terms from ontologies, vocabularies and coding standards. OxO imports mappings from a variety of sources including the Ontology Lookup Service and a subset of mappings provided by the UMLS.

#### BioPortal: The National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) BioPortal

BioPortal provides access to commonly used biomedical ontologies and to tools for working with them. BioPortal allows you to:
- browse the library of ontologies
- search for a term across multiple ontologies
- browse mappings between terms in different ontologies
- receive recommendations on which ontologies are most relevant for a corpus
- annotate text with terms from ontologies
- search biomedical resources for a term
- browse a selection of projects that use BioPortal resources
